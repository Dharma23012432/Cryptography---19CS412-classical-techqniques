# Hill Cipher
Hill Cipher using with different key values

# AIM:

To encrypt and decrypt the given message by using Ceaser Cipher encryption algorithm.


## DESIGN STEPS:

### Step 1:

Design of Caeser Cipher algorithnm 

### Step 2:

Implementation using C or pyhton code

### Step 3:

1.	In Ceaser Cipher each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
2.	For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.
3.	The encryption can also be represented using modular arithmetic by first transforming the letters into numbers, according to the   
    scheme, A = 0, B = 1, Z = 25.
4.	Encryption of a letter x by a shift n can be described mathematically as,
                       En(x) = (x + n) mod26
5.	Decryption is performed similarly,
                       Dn (x)=(x - n) mod26

ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION:
The Hill cipher is a substitution cipher invented by Lester S. Hill in 1929. Each letter is represented by a number modulo 26. To encrypt a message, each block of n letters is multiplied by an invertible n × n matrix, again modulus 26.
To decrypt the message, each block is multiplied by the inverse of the matrix used for encryption. The matrix used for encryption is the cipher key, and it should be chosen randomly from the set of invertible n × n matrices (modulo 26).
The cipher can, be adapted to an alphabet with any number of letters. All arithmetic just needs to be done modulo the number of letters instead of modulo 26.


## PROGRAM:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>
void main()
{
    char plain[20],cipher[20];
    int key,i,length;
    int result;
    printf("\n Enter the plain text:");
    scanf("%s", plain);
    printf("\n Enter the key value:");
    scanf("%d", &key);
    printf("\n \n \t PLAIN TEXt: %s", plain);
    printf("\n \n \t ENCRYPTED TEXT:");
    for(i=0, length = strlen(plain); i<length; i++)
    {      
        cipher[i]=plain[i] + key;
        if (isupper(plain[i]) && (cipher[i] > 'Z'))
        cipher[i] = cipher[i] - 26;
        if (islower(plain[i]) && (cipher[i] > 'z'))
        cipher[i] = cipher[i] - 26;
        printf("%c", cipher[i]);
    }
    printf("\n \n \t AFTER DECRYPTION : ");
    for(i=0;i<length;i++)
    {  
        plain[i]=cipher[i]-key;
        if(isupper(cipher[i])&&(plain[i]<'A'))
        plain[i]=plain[i]+26;
        if(islower(cipher[i])&&(plain[i]<'a'))
        plain[i]=plain[i]+26;
        printf("%c",plain[i]);
    }
    getchar();
}
```
